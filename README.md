# historical-monuments-of-INDIA
webpage on historical monuments in INDIA using flexbox in HTML and CSS
I created this webpage using Visual studio code
I mainly used three things in this webpage
header,footer and flexbox
I used the <style> attribute and aligned the header using text-align function to the middle
and set the font-size to xx-large
in the footer I aligned the text to the right and set the font-size to x-large
I aligned the images using flexbox and in the flex.container I set the display to flex
and using flex-wrap i wrapped the images
and to get even space around the images i used justify-content and set space-around
padding set to 0 20px 20px
to give the images a curved border i set the border-radius to 8px

  Now in the body i added the footer as Historical monuments of INDIA using <header> function using <div class=flex-container"> I_ set all the images 
all the images in the webpage are responsive and i used an anchor tag to the images
so when you click on the image you will be redirected to wikipedia of the respective image
the addresses of the images are also taken from wikipedia
width of the images is set to 430px and height to 330px
